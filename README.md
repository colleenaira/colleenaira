# Hola, World! <img src="https://github.com/colleenaira/colleenaira/blob/main/Assets/Earth.gif" width="29px">


I am _Colleen Cipriano_. I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/"> <b>University of Victoria</b>, BC</a> and I'm studying Combined Computer Science and Psychology. With interdisciplinary skills in technology and social science, I am interested in how humans and computers can interact with each other and how technology can reflect human intelligence. As an undergrad, I am obsessed with the idea of continuous learning and improvement. My interests include project management, UX/UI design & research, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and more.
