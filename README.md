# Hello, World! &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Earth.gif" width="29px">


I am _Colleen Cipriano_. I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/"> <b>University of Victoria</b>, BC</a> and I'm studying a Combined Computer Science and Psychology. With interdisciplinary skills in technology and social science, I am interested in how humans and computers can interact with each other and how technology can reflect human intelligence. As an undergrad, I am obssessed with the idea of continuous learning and improvement. My interests include project management, research, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and more.
